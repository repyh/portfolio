I'm located in Indonesia and currently studying in High-School.<br/><br/>I started off programming with C++ in middle school, taught directly by my IT teacher. I continue to develop my skills by learning Javascript right before the pandemic. I learned alot throughout the years from making a simple discord bot into making a full stack app demo.<br/><br/>I'm sure I still have alot to learn and master over time and will continue to improve further and sharpen my skill.</code></p>
